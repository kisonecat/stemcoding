If this is your very first exercise please take this pre-survey about
your programming experience!

Now make sure to take the pre-survey about motion linked here!

This lab will guide you through coding up a web-based implementation
of the classic video game asteroids. You will need to bring your
laptop to the lab or use the available computers. Unfortunately,
tablets will probably not work very well unless you have an external
keyboard.

This example will use a programming language that is very similar to C
and C++ programming. (Note: If you are familiar with C or C++ the main
difference you will see is that there is no main() function and
instead the draw() function serves this role.)
