In the classic game of Asteroids, there is a little ship that flies
around in space, very far away from stars and planets so that the
gravitational acceleration is zero.

The code is designed to solve the (rather simple) kinematic equations
in this case. If we just consider the x-direction forces the equations
look like this:
\begin{align*}
\sum F_{net,x} &= F_{\rm thrust} = ma_x \\
\Delta v_x &= a_x \Delta t \\
v_x &= v_{x0} + \Delta v_x \\
x &= x_0 + v_x \cdot \Delta t
\end{align*}

The computer program we will work with here computes these equations
over and over again, updating $v_x$ and $x$ depending on whether the
thrust is turned on or off. Since the thrust is the only force, if it
is turned off then $a_x = 0$ and $\Delta v_x = 0$ and the ship just
continues with the same $v_x$ velocity. This is how the code works if
the ship only moves in the $x$ direction. The equations are essentially
the same for the y direction. In the last step of this lab you will
modify the code so that the ship can move in the $y$ direction too.
