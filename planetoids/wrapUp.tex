After finishing this lab make sure to complete the post-quiz for this
lab!  How to get full credit on this assignment!

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make absolutely sure that the ship can turn and move in two dimensions
\item Complete one of the challenges.  Most people choose the reverse thrusters, which is probably the easiest.
\item Comment on the trajectory/path of the ship.
\item Find the best choice of Fthrust and mass to survive.  Comment on your choice in the comment box when you submit in the code. (Food for thought: Is this a trick question?)
\item Submit your code before the deadline
\end{enumerate}
